# RemoteApp

**RemoteApp** is an application designed to run on a RemoteApp Machine, providing users with remote access to specific software without needing a full remote desktop session. It features auto-fill functionality to enhance user experience by automating input tasks.

By supporting various connection protocols, RemoteApp offers users flexible options to connect to assets securely and efficiently. This makes it an ideal solution for accessing business-critical applications remotely, while simplifying management and improving security.
