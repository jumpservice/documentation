# RemoteApp machine

**RemoteApp machine** is a Windows host used to deploy RemoteApp services and install remote applications. Users can access and use the applications on this host remotely, enabling centralized management and remote usage.

**Tinker** is a tool provided by JumpServer for automating the deployment of RemoteApp services and publishing remote applications.  When a user connects to a remote application, Tinker is also responsible for launching the application and performing auto-fill operations. Tinker is automatically installed by JumpServer during the deployment of the publishing machine.

## Prerequisites

The RemoteApp machine must meet the following requirements:

- Running Windows Server 2019 operating system.
- At least 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of RAM.
- OpenSSH or WinRM is installed and configured.
- Remote Desktop Services (RDS) license is installed and activated.
- Network access to JumpServer over HTTP/HTTPS is available.

## Create a RemoteApp machine

<Steps>
<div>
<Nav name="system-settings" />
</div>

<div>
In the left menu, click **<Icon name="Application" /> RemoteApp**.
</div>

<div>
On the right page, click **RemoteApp machine** tab.
</div>

<div>
Above the table, click **+ Create**.
</div>

<div>
In the **Name** field, type RemoteApp machine’s name.
</div>

<div>
In the **IP/Host** field, type the IP address or hostname.
</div>

<div>
In the **Protocols** field, set the protocol and port.
- `rdp` is required for users to connect to the RemoteApp.
- `ssh` requires the OpenSSH service to be installed on the machine.
- `winrm` requires the WinRM service to be installed on the machine.

You must select either ssh or winrm, as JumpServer uses them to manage the RemoteApp machine, including initial deployment and RemoteApp publishing.

</div>

<div>
In the **Accounts** field, add an account to manage the machine. It must meet the following requirements:
- The account is a member of the Windows Administrators group.
- Privileged is enabled.
</div>

<div>
Optionally, check **Using same account** to enable login with the same username. 

When the user connects to a RemoteApp , JumpServer will prioritize using a user with the same username to log in RemoteApp machine. This is especially useful when both JumpServer and the RemoteApp machine are integrated with the same AD/LDAP service.

For this feature to work, you need to set `CACHE_LOGIN_PASSWORD_ENABLED=true` in the `config.txt` file and restart the service.
</Alert>

</div>

<div>
Optionally, check **Auto create accounts** to generate two types of accounts automatically:

- `js_`  Private accounts use the prefix js_ followed by the user’s username.
- `jms_` Public accounts use the prefix jms_ followed by a random string.

When a user connects to a RemoteApp, the system first tries to log in to the RemoteApp machine using the `js_` account, which is private and unique to the user.
If the RemoteApp on that machine doesn't support concurrent sessions for the same user, the system will instead use a random public `jms_` account.

</div>

<div>
Optionally, set **Accounts Create Amount** to specify the number of public `jms_` accounts.
</div>

<div>
In the **Core API** field, type the JumpServer IP address or hostname.
</div>

<div>
Optionally, check **Ignore certificate verification** to specify whether to ignore the certificate when Tinker accesses Core API.
</div>

<div>
Optionally, check **Existing RDS license** to use your own license. If unchecked, a 120-day trial license will be used. For more information, see [RDS licensing documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-client-access-license).

<Steps stepLevel="2">
  <div>
  In the **RDS license server** field, type the RDS license server address.

  </div>

  <div>
  In the **RDS licensing mode** field, choose the licensing mode.
  </div>

  <div>
  In the **RDS single session per user** field, set whether each user is allowed to have only one RDS session. If enabled, when a user connects a second session, the first session will be disconnected.
  </div>

  <div>
  In the **RDS max disconnection time (ms)** field, defines the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) a disconnected session remains active.
  </div>

  <div>
  In the **RDS remote app logoff time limit (ms)** field, specifies how long the system waits before logging off a user after all RemoteApp programs are closed.

  </div>
</Steps>
</div>

<div>
Optionally, in the **Zone** field, select only one zone.
</div>

<div>
Check **Active** to enable this RemoteApp machine.
</div>

<div>
Optionally, type a description for this machine.
</div>

<div>
Click **Submit** or **Save & Continue**.
</div>

</Steps>

## Deploy the RemoteApp machine

<Steps>

<div>
<Nav name="system-settings" />
</div>

<div>
In the left menu, click **<Icon name="Application" /> RemoteApp**.
</div>

<div>
On the right page, click **RemoteApp machine** tab.
</div>

<div>
In the table, find the RemoteApp machine and click its name.
</div>

<div>
On the details page, click the **Deploy publishing machine** tab.
</div>

<div>
In the "Quick Update" card on the right, find "Initialization deployment" and click **Deploy**. This will start a task to initialize the deployment of the RemoteApp machine and publish all RemoteApp.
</div>

<div>
In the table on the left, you can view the deployment history and deployment logs.
