# RemoteApp machine
This topic describes how to add and initialize a RemoteApp machine.

## Prerequisites
- Prepare a Windows Server 2019 (recommended) or Windows Server 2016 as the RemoteApp machine.
- Ensure the RemoteApp machine is at least 4 cores and 8GB of memory.
- Ensure OpenSSH or WinRM is properly configured on the RemoteApp machine.
- Ensure the RDS license is properly configured on the RemoteApp machine.
- Ensure the RemoteApp machine can access JumpServer (HTTP/HTTPS).

## Create a RemoteApp machine
<Steps>

<div>
<Nav name="system-settings" />
</div>

<div>
Navigate to the **System settings > RemoteApp  > RemoteApp machine**.
</div>

<div>
Click **Create** above the RemoteApp machine list.
</div>

<div>
In the **Name** field, type the RemoteApp machine's name.
</div>

<div>
In the **IP/Host** field, type the RemoteApp machine's IP/Host.
</div>

<div>
In the **Protocols** field, add or remove protocols and modify ports. The platform determines the available protocols.
Ensure to select either SSH and RDP, or WinRM and RDP at the same time. SSH or WinRM is used to manage the RemoteApp machine.
<Alert type="important">
When using WinRM for management, ensure WinRM is enabled on the Windows Server. You can use `winrm quickconfig` to enable it.

When using SSH for management, ensure OpenSSH is installed and enabled on the Windows Server.
</Alert>
</div>

<div>
In the **Accounts** field, add a Windows user who is a member of the administrators group, either directly or from a template. 
Ensure the user is in the administrators group and enable **Privileged** in JumpServer, otherwise the RemoteApp machine will not function properly.

</div>

<div>
Optionally, in the **Using same account** field, enable or disable this feature.

</div>

<div>
Optionally, in the **Auto create accounts** field, enable or disable the feature.
