# Integrate OAuth2 authentication <Icon name="xpackTip"/>

## About OAuth2
**Open Authorization 2.0 (OAuth2)** is an open authorization protocol that allows third-party applications to access user resources stored on other service providers (such as Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) without exposing the user's password. OAuth2 enables users to grant third-party applications specific resource permissions without sharing their login credentials.

## How to configure

</div>

<div>
In the **Authorization endpoint** field, enter the OAuth2 authorization endpoint, such as "https://&#8203;github.com/login/oauth/authorize".
</div>

<div>
In the **Token endpoint** field, enter the OAuth2 token endpoint, such as "https://&#8203;github.com/login/oauth/access_token".

```json copy=true filename="OAuth2 User Attribute Example"
{
  "name": "user",
  "username": "name",
  "email": "user:email"
}
```

In the **Always update user** field, when checked, after OAuth2 user authentication, user information (only includes: name, username, email, phone, comment) will be updated each time, "groups" are only synchronized when the user is created.
</div>

<div>
In the **Logout completely** field, when checked, the user will be logged out from the OAuth2 service by calling the "End session endpoint" upon logging out.
</div>

<div>
Click **Submit**.
