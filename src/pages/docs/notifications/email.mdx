# Email service configuration guide

In JumpServer, the email server is an essential configuration and it is strongly recommended to enable and properly set it up. It is primarily used for communication between the system and users, including account security, notification alerts, and system warnings.

JumpServer supports configuring the email server in two ways: using the standard SMTP protocol or Microsoft Exchange Server.
