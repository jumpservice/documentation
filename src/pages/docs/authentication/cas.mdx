# Integrate CAS authentication

## About CAS

**Central Authentication Service (CAS)** is a Single Sign-On (SSO) protocol designed to provide centralized authentication for multiple applications. Developed by Yale University, CAS allows users to access multiple protected services with a single login, eliminating the need to re-enter credentials. It implements authentication through a "ticket" mechanism and supports various identity providers, such as databases, LDAP, and OAuth.


## How to configure
<Steps>
<div>
<Nav name="system-settings" />
</div>

<div>
Navigate to **System settings > Authentication > CAS**.
</div>

<div>
In the **CAS** field, check to enable CAS authentication.
</div>

<div>
In the **Server** field,  type the CAS server URI, such as "https://&#8203;example.com/cas".
</div>

<div>
In the **Proxy server** field,  type the CAS proxy server URI if behind a proxy. For example, if the host listens on "http://&#8203;foo.bar:8080" but requests use "https://&#8203;foo.bar:8443", enter "https://&#8203;foo.bar:8443", For more information, see [Django CAS configuration](https://djangocas.dev/docs/latest/configuration.html#cas-root-proxied-as-optional).
</div>

<div>
In the **Version** field, type the CAS protocol version: 1, 2, 3, or CAS_2_SAML_1_0.

The default is "3".

<div>
In the **User attribute** field, type the user attribute mapping. The key represents the CAS user attribute name, while the value corresponds to the JumpServer user attribute name (available options: name, username, email, groups, phone, comment).
```json copy=true filename="CAS User Attribute Example"
{
  "cas:user": "username",
  "cas:fullname": "name",
  "cas:mail": "email",
}
```
</div>

<div>
<Icon name="xpack"/> In the **Organization** field, after authentication and creation, the user will be added to the selected organization.
</div>

<div>
In the **Create user** field, when checked, a user will be created upon successful authentication.
<Alert type="warning">
