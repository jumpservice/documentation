# Integrate OAuth2 authentication <Icon name="xpackTip"/>

## About OAuth2
**Open Authorization 2.0 (OAuth2)** is an open authorization protocol that allows third-party applications to access user resources stored on other service providers (such as Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) without exposing the user's password. OAuth2 enables users to grant third-party applications specific resource permissions without sharing their login credentials.

## How to configure
<Steps>

<div>
<Nav name="system-settings" />
</div>

<div>
Navigate to **System settings > Authentication > OAuth2**.
</div>

<div>
In the **OAuth2** field, check to enable OAuth2 authentication.
</div>

<div>
In the **Service provider** field, type the OAuth2 service provider name, such as GitHub, Google, Facebook, etc.
</div>

<div>
In the **Logo** field, upload the OAuth2 service provider logo, recommended to use a size of _64px * 64px_.

The Service provider and logo will be displayed on the login page.

</div>

<div>
In the **Client ID** field, type the client ID provided by the OAuth2 service provider.
</div>

<div>
In the **Client secret** field, type the client secret provided by the OAuth2 service provider.
</div>

<div>
In the **Request method** field, select a method to obtain a token.

    <HorizontalTable 
      headers={['Request Method', 'Description']} 
      rows={[
        [
          "GET", 
          "Use the GET method to obtain the token, with the client ID and client secret included in the request headers."
        ],
        [
          "POST-DATA", 
          "Use the POST method to obtain a token, with client ID and client secret included as \"raw data\" in the request body."
        ],
        [
          "POST-JSON", 
          "Use the POST method to obtain a token, with client ID and client secret included as \"JSON data\" in the request body."
        ],
      ]}
    />
</div>

<div>
In the **Scope** field, defines the range of user information that the client requests access to in an authorization request. Multiple pieces of information are separated by spaces, such as "user user:email user:login".
</div>

<div>
In the **Authorization endpoint** field, type the OAuth2 authorization endpoint, such as "https://&#8203;github.com/login/oauth/authorize".
</div>

<div>
In the **Token endpoint** field, type the OAuth2 token endpoint, such as "https://&#8203;github.com/login/oauth/access_token".
</div>

<div>
In the **Userinfo endpoint** field, type the OAuth2 userinfo endpoint, such as "https://&#8203;api.github.com/user".
</div>

<div>
In the **End session endpoint** field, type the OAuth2 end session endpoint, such as "https://&#8203;github.com/logout", when the user logs out, this endpoint will be called.
</div>

<div>
In the **User attribute** field, type the user attribute mapping. The key represents the JumpServer user attribute name (available options: name, username, email, groups, phone, comment), while the value corresponds to the OAuth2 user attribute name.

```json copy=true filename="OAuth2 User Attribute Example"
{
  "name": "user",
  "username": "name",
  "email": "user:email"
}
```
</div>

<div>
In the **Organization** field, after authentication and creation, the user will be added to the selected organization.
</div>

<div>
In the **Always update user** field, when checked, after OAuth2 user authentication, user information (only includes: name, username, email, phone, comment) will be updated each time, "groups" are only synchronized when the user is created.
</div>

<div>
In the **Logout completely** field, when checked, the user will be logged out from the OAuth2 service by calling the "End session endpoint" upon logging out.
</div>

<div>
Click **Submit**.
