<Alert type="warning">
It is not recommended to use the privileged account to change its own secret, as it may lead to the account being locked out or inaccessible after the change.
If you still want to use the privileged account to change its own secret, set or add "CHANGE_AUTH_PLAN_SECURE_MODE_ENABLED=false" in the config file and restart the service.
