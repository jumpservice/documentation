# About roles

## What is the roles?
In JumpServer, **Roles** are a core feature used to control user permissions. Through **Roles**, administrators can define the scope of the system that users can access, ensuring system security and compliance.

In JumpServer, **Roles** are divided into **System roles** and **Organisational roles**.

## System roles
**System roles** are roles that apply universally across all organizations within the platform. These roles allow you to define specific permissions and access levels for users across the entire system. Changes made to system roles will affect all organizations using the platform.

In JumpServer, there are 4 built-in **System roles**. **System Admin**, **System Auditor**, **System Components** and **Users**. These built-in system roles can only be used and cannot be modified.

> - **System Admin**: Has all the privileges of the JumpServer system.

> - **System Auditor**: Has all the auditing privileges of the JumpServer system.

> - **System Components**: For use by system components.

> - **Users**: Has general user privileges.


## Organizational roles
**Organization roles** are roles tailored to individual organizations within the platform. These roles are assigned when inviting users to join a particular organization and dictate their permissions and access levels within that organization. Unlike system roles, organization roles are customizable and apply only within the scope of the organization they are assigned to.

In JumpServer, there are 3 built-in **Organizational roles **. **Organisational Admin**, **Organisational Auditor** and **Organisational user**. These built-in organisational roles can only be used and cannot be modified.
 
 > - **Organisational Admin**: Has all the privileges of the organisation.

 > - **Organisational Auditor**: Has all the auditing privileges of the organisation.

 > - **Organisational user**: Has general user privileges of the organisation.
