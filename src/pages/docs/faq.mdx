## Why doesn’t Ctrl+V enter Visual Block mode in Web Terminal (Luna)?

The Web Terminal (Luna) page is built on xterm.js, and since xterm.js interprets `Ctrl + V` as a paste command, this shortcut cannot be used to enter Vim’s Visual Block mode.

Vim provides an alternative shortcut, `Ctrl + Q`, which serves the same purpose and is functionally equivalent to `Ctrl + V` for entering Visual Block mode.
