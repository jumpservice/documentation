This guide shows you how to install JumpServer on your platform.

## One-line installation script 

You can run a one-line command to install JumpServer on a Linux server. 

1. Prepare a clean Linux Server ( 64bit, >= 4c8g ), download and run the installation script on the server where you want to install JumpServer:

```sh
curl -sSL https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/releases/download/v4.0.0/quick_start.sh | bash
```

2. You have successfully installed JumpServer. You can now access the JumpServer service using your web browser by navigating to `http://your-jumpserver-ip/`. For the best experience, we recommend using Google Chrome.
