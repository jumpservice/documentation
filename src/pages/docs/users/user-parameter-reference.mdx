# User parameters reference

This topic provides a detailed description of user parameters. All parameters can be provided when creating or updating a user.

## Name

`required`

The name is used to identify a user.

## Username

`required` `unique`

The username is used to log in to JumpServer.

## Email

`required` `unique`

The user email is primarily used to receive system notifications. 
It also supports the following functions:
- Users can use their email as the username to log in to JumpServer.
- Used for password recovery.
- Serves as a backend for multi-factor authentication (MFA) and receive MFA codes.

For more information about configuring the email service, see [Email service configuration guide](/docs/notifications/email).

## Groups

User groups are used for organizing and managing users. A user can belong to multiple groups.

## Password setting

(Create local user only) Choose the method for setting the password for a newly created user.

- Reset link will be generated and sent to the user

  This will send a password setup email to the user. The user can log in after resetting the password as instructed.

- Set password

  Manually set password. The user can log in directly with this password.

## Change secret

(Edit local user only) When editing a user, check to update the user’s password.

## Password

(Local user only) The user can log in to the system using this password. 

Password rules can be configured in the system settings, including requirements for length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

When `Password must be changed during next login` is checked, the user will be required to change the password immediately after the first successful login.

## MFA
Configure the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) policy for a single user. You can also configure a global MFA policy in the system settings.

- Disabled

  MFA is disabled by default, but users can enable it from their profile page. 

- Enabled

  MFA is enabled for the user, but they can disable it from their profile page.

- Force enabled

  MFA is enforced for the user, and they cannot disable it.

After MFA is enabled, users will be guided to set up MFA during their first login.

MFA backends support the following options, which must be enabled by the administrator in the system settings before users can configure them from their profile page:
- OTP
- SMS
- Email
- Passkey
- Facial recognition

## Source
User source identifies the user authentication backend. JumpServer supports integrating and enabling multiple authentication services simultaneously. When the same user exists in multiple services, this field helps distinguish the user’s source. **Local** user belongs to the local database.

When a user logs in, the system will, by default, authenticate them using all enabled backends sequentially. Administrators can also configure the system to allow authentication only from the user’s source, which helps improve authentication efficiency.

## System roles

`required`

System roles define a user’s position in the system and grant only the permissions assigned to each role. Multiple system roles can be assigned, with permissions combined.

Built-in roles include: 
- User
- System Admin
- System Auditor

<Alert type="xpack">

Built-in roles include: 
- User
- Organization Admin

You can click **Manage role** to view existing roles or create new ones.

## Active
Active controls the user’s activation status. Being active is one of the requirements for logging into the system. 

Additionally, the administrator can configure in System Settings to automatically disable users who have not logged in for an extended period.

## Date expired

You can set a future expiration date for a user in advance. Once the user expires, they can't log in to JumpServer.

You can also set the default expiration days for new users in the configuration file. For more information, see [USER_DEFAULT_EXPIRED_DAYS](/docs/configuration#user_default_expired_days).

## Phone

The user’s mobile phone number can be used to receive MFA codes.
