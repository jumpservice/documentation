# Endpoint rules

Endpoint rules define how the system selects service endpoints based on rules when users connect to assets. By configuring endpoint rules, you can control and optimize access to assets, ensuring that users connect through the most appropriate endpoints based on predefined conditions.

For the server endpoint selection strategy, there are currently two options:
1. Specify the endpoint according to the endpoint rule (current page);
2. Choose the endpoint through asset tags, with the fixed tag name being "endpoint" and the value being the name of the endpoint.

The tag matching method is preferred for both methods, as the ip range may conflict, and the tag method exists as a supplement to the rules.
