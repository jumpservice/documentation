# Monitoring

JumpServer provides a built-in monitoring page that allows administrators to monitor the real-time status of components.
The page aggregates and displays status statistics for various components, including the number of components in normal, higher(high-load), serious(critical-load), and offline states, as well as the total number of active sessions for each component type.
