# Endpoint 

A service endpoint is the address (and port) through which users access the service.
When users connect to assets, the system selects a service endpoint based on [Endpoint rules](/docs/components/endpoint-rules) and asset tags, and uses it as the access point to establish a connection, enabling distributed access to assets.

## Create endpoint

<Steps>

<Nav name="system-settings" />
</div>

</div>

<div>
Click **+ Create**.
</div>

<div>
In the **Name** field, type a name for the endpoint.
</div>

<div>
In the **Host** field, type the domain name of the endpoint.
The host address accessed when connecting to assets, if it is empty, the access address of the current browser will be used (the default endpoint does not allow modification of the host)
