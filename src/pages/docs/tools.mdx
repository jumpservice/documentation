# Tools

You can use the following tools in JumpServer for network testing and troubleshooting:
- `ping`: Checks whether a host or network is reachable, used to verify network connectivity.
- `telnet`: Tests the connectivity of a specified host and port, commonly used to verify if a service port is open.
- `nmap`: Scans hosts and ports on the network for security and network analysis.
- `tcpdump`: Captures and analyzes network packets to help diagnose communication issues.
- `traceroute`: Traces the path of data packets to the target host to analyze network latency or routing problems.
